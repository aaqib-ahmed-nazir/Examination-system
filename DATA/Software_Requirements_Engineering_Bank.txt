What is the difference between user requirements and system requirements?
Option: User requirements specify the technical details of the software, while system requirements focus on user expectations.
Option: User requirements focus on functionality, while system requirements specify the hardware and software environment.
Option dabfac4: User requirements define what the software should do from the user's perspective, while system requirements define how the software should operate and integrate with the overall system.
Option: User requirements and system requirements are interchangeable terms.
