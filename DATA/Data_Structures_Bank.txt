What is a binary search tree?
Option: A data structure that stores elements in a sorted manner using a linked list.
Option dabfac4: A binary tree in which the left child of a node contains smaller elements, and the right child contains larger elements.
Option: A data structure that allows elements to be accessed randomly using their indices.
Option: A tree structure that allows multiple children for each node.
