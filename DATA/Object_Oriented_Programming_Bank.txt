What is encapsulation in object-oriented programming?
Option: It is a mechanism to restrict access to the data and methods of an object.
Option: It is a process of creating multiple instances of a class.
Option dabfac4: It is a technique to combine data and code into a single unit called an object.
Option: It is a way to establish relationships between different classes.

True or False: Polymorphism refers to the ability of an object to take on many different forms or types.
Option dabfac4: True
Option: False

b94d27b
Polymorphism in C++ allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of the same class.
Option dabfac4: True
Option: False

Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from multiple parent classes, enabling multiple inheritance in object-oriented programming.
Option dabfac4: False
Option: True

What is the purpose of a constructor in C++?
Option: To allocate memory for an object.
Option: To initialize the data members of an object.
Option: To define the member functions of a class.
Option dabfac4: All of the above.

Option dabfac4: True
Option: False

What is the concept of method overriding in C++?
Option: It allows a derived class to define a new method with the same name as a method in the base class.
Option: It allows a derived class to inherit the methods of the base class.
Option: It allows a derived class to access the private members of the base class.
Option dabfac4: It allows a derived class to provide a different implementation of a method defined in the base class.
